# Gachhan 🎀
*A cozy gacha-style Discord bot made with love for a roleplay FFXIV community.* 

Gacchan is a Discord bot designed to bring fun and cuteness to a small online community through randomized card pulls, rarity collections, and more. This project combines backend logic, slash command support, and a themed UX for a highly interactive and immersive experience.

Gacchan’s playful features and RP flavor are inspired by Neopets, the site that first sparked my interest in HTML, CSS, and digital creativity. Gacchan carries a little of that whimsical energy into it.

## 💖 Why I Made This

This bot was originally created as a personal side project for someone close to me and our in-game community. I wanted to bring my personality into something they’d actually use and love, and in doing so, I learned a lot about bot development, deployment, and building for others.
